- This project collected GitHub users in Tokyo with more than 200 followers and their repositories.
- The analysis revealed that most Tokyo-based GitHub users work in similar fields, with certain languages being significantly more popular.
- Developers in Tokyo could improve visibility by focusing on more popular languages and contributing to public repositories.

### Scrapping Data Process
Using the GitHub API, I retrieved user profiles and repositories by iterating through API pages, saving each user's relevant details to `users.csv` and repositories to `repositories.csv`.

### Key Findings
- Tokyo GitHub users favor certain companies and technologies, with a notable trend in language popularity like JavaScript.
- Certain types of repositories tend to attract higher star ratings.

### Recommendations
Developers should focus on contributing to repositories in trending languages to increase visibility and followers.
